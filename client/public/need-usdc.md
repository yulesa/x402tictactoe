# Getting USDC for the Demo

## Option A: Possible when the Demo is running on Testnet (Free)

For Base Sepolia testnet, you can get free test USDC:

1. Go to the CDP Faucet at [faucet.cdp.coinbase.com](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet)
2. Select "Base Sepolia" network and USDC token
3. Paste your wallet address
4. Claim USDC tokens

The faucet will send test USDC to your wallet. These tokens have no real value but work exactly like the real thing for testing purposes.

## Option B: When the the Demo is running on Mainnet (Real Money)

For Base mainnet, you need real USDC. There are many ways of buying it. We suggest Peanut because they accept PIX, but bridging to browser wallet will be necessary. Although Peanut is also a wallet it doesn't allow direct app connection.

1. **Sign up to Peanut.me** — Use your phone and head to [peanut.me](https://peanut.me). You can use the invite YULEINVITESYOU547.
2. **Add funds** — Click "Add" to add funds, if this is your first time, you need to pass through verification (Know your Client is required in this step). You can use PIX as payment method. Make sure to add at least 1 USD value.
3. **Bridge funds to your wallet** — Click "Withdraw" to allow sending the funds to another address. Select Crypto as method. Select BASE network and USDC token. Paste your wallet in the wallet address field. Review and confirm.

*This was terrible, right? Bridging makes everything more complex, because it exposes to the user blockchain details. No browser wallet currently has a good on-ramp (purchasing crypto), they don't accept PIX, require user to pre-select especify which token and which network. Peanut has a good UX, however don't allow app connection to sign transactions. We are working on that!*
